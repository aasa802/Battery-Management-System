Battery Management System Setup Guide
Overview
This guide will help you set up the Battery Management System (BMS) using an Arduino or compatible microcontroller, along with the necessary sensors for monitoring battery performance.

Hardware Requirements
Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, ESP8266, or any compatible board)
Voltage Sensor Module
Current Sensor Module
Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT11, or DS18B20)
Relay Module (for controlling charging/discharging)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
Battery Pack (Li-ion or Li-Po battery for testing)
Wiring Diagram
Below is a simple wiring diagram to connect the sensors and relay to your Arduino. Ensure to follow the pin connections as described below.
         +----------------+
         |   Arduino      |
         |                |
         |   A0  ----->   |----> Voltage Sensor
         |   A1  ----->   |----> Current Sensor
         |   A2  ----->   |----> Temperature Sensor
         |   D2  ----->   |----> Relay Module (Control Pin)
         |                |
         +----------------+
Pin Connections
Voltage Sensor:

Connect the sensor's VCC to Arduino 5V.
Connect the sensor's GND to Arduino GND.
Connect the sensor's output pin to Arduino A0.
Current Sensor:

Connect the sensor's VCC to Arduino 5V.
Connect the sensor's GND to Arduino GND.
Connect the sensor's output pin to Arduino A1.
Temperature Sensor:

For LM35: Connect the VCC to Arduino 5V, GND to GND, and output pin to A2.
For DHT11: Connect VCC to Arduino 5V, GND to GND, and data pin to A2 (use a pull-up resistor if required).
Relay Module:

Connect VCC to Arduino 5V.
Connect GND to Arduino GND.
Connect the control pin (IN) of the relay to Arduino D2.
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.
Libraries: Install necessary libraries for your sensors through the Arduino Library Manager:
DHT Sensor Library (if using DHT11)
OneWire and DallasTemperature libraries (if using DS18B20)
Installation Steps
Step 1: Install Arduino IDE
Download the Arduino IDE for your operating system.
Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for and install the required libraries:
For DHT11: Search for DHT sensor library and install.
For LM35 or DS18B20: Search for DallasTemperature and install if applicable.
Step 3: Upload the Code
Open the bms.ino file in the Arduino IDE (ensure you have written the necessary code as described in the previous sections).
Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
Select the correct board and port in the IDE:
Tools > Board > Select your board type (e.g., Arduino Uno).
Tools > Port > Select the COM port of your Arduino.
Click the Upload button (right arrow icon) to upload the code to your Arduino.
Step 4: Power the System
After successfully uploading the code, disconnect the Arduino from the USB and power it with an appropriate battery pack.
Ensure all connections are secure and that the battery is connected properly.
Testing the System
Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (Ctrl + Shift + M or go to Tools > Serial Monitor).
Set the baud rate to 9600 to see the real-time readings for voltage, current, and temperature.
Monitor the output for any alerts related to under-voltage or over-temperature conditions.
Important Notes
Safety: Always handle batteries with care. Follow proper safety guidelines to prevent short circuits or accidents.
Calibration: Depending on your sensor specifications, you may need to calibrate the sensors for accurate readings.
Relay Control: Make sure to test the relay with a lower voltage load first to ensure proper operation.
By following this setup guide, you should be able to successfully assemble and run your Battery Management System. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the Arduino documentation or the sensor datasheets for troubleshooting.
